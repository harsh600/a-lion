# a-lion
A Lion lay asleep in the forest, his graat head resting on his paws. A timid little Mouse came upon him unexpectedly, and in her fright and haste to get away, ran towards the Lion's nose. Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her.

"Spare me!" begged the poor Mouse. "Please let me go and some day I will surely repay you."

The Lion was more amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go.
